# Datagraph (AVR)
Data graph of industrial sensors in noisy environments without distance limit.
This Repostory is Files of a project that is measuring desired parameters by industrial sensors and perform pre-processing in slave units if needed. After data is going to send to master unit by digital connections and industrial ports. finally data is shown in LCD.
This system has a powerful AVR micro controller (ATMEGA32). this MCU receives data from slave units, performs userâ€™s processing on data and shows useful information of data on output chart in real-time mode. 
UI designing is very simple and user friendly and Data is shown in two different way: Chart mode and Numeral mode.
